# Pandemic Models

There are some simple ways to model pandemics based on differential equations.

This repo contains some of those models, along with an interactive graph to play around with different values.

Red line represents exponential growth

Green line represents logistic growth

The other three lines show the SIR model: The blue line shows (S)usceptible population, the purple line shows the (I)nfected population, and the cyan line shows the (R)emoved population.
